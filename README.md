## üí° Goals

Accessing dependable and trustworthy local services can be difficult in today's fast-paced environment. People often face difficulties in finding trustworthy providers for tasks such as gardening, carpentry, and tutoring within their communities. This lack of a centralized, secure platform contributes to uncertainties surrounding service quality, reliability, and safety.

To address this issue, we present you **Servify**, a platform designed to connect individuals seeking local services with qualified providers on blockchain, for unparalleled credibility, accountability and authenticity.

## üß† Knowledge Primer

 - **Anon Aadhaar** is a zero-knowledge protocol that allows Aadhaar ID owners to prove their identity in a privacy preserving way. It provides a set of tools to generate and verify proofs, authenticate users and verify proofs on-chain.
 - **Scroll** is a Layer 2 blockchain platform that aims to scale Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and then committing them to the main Ethereum chain. It utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify the validity of these off-chain transactions without revealing the underlying data, ensuring scalability, privacy, and security.
 - **Push Protocol** Push Protocol, formerly known as EPNS, is a Web3 communication protocol that enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dApps, wallets, and services. It provides a decentralized and gasless way for users to receive real-time updates and interact with Web3 applications.



## üö© What Problems Servify Solves
 - **Lack of a Centralized Hub:** The absence of a centralized platform for local services with verified credibility creates difficulties for individuals looking to connect with reliable service providers within their communities.
 - **Trust and Security Concerns:** Current methods for verifying service providers often fall short in establishing trust and security, leading to reservations among users about the reliability of the services offered.
 - **Need for Anonymity and Verification:** Anon Aadhaar will serve as a solution to balance the need for user anonymity with the requirement for identity verification, offering a secure and privacy-centric approach to establishing trust.
 - **Community-Based Exchanges:** The proposed platform aims to facilitate secure and reliable exchanges within the community, fostering a sense of safety and accountability among users.

Servify addresses these challenges by leveraging Anon Aadhaar verification to create a transparent, and secure environment for local service exchanges.

## üëî Emphasis on Tracks

### Ethereum Foundation: Anon Aadhar
 - **Usage**: Anon Aadhar is being utilised as proof of citizenship and identity in Servify, to maintain anonimity while provisioning credibility.
 - **Implementation**:

**React context provider Anon Aadhaar**

```
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}>
      <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}>
        <AnonAadhaarProvider _appId={ANON_AADHAAR_APP_ID}>
          <App />
        </AnonAadhaarProvider>
      </RainbowKitProvider>
    </WagmiConfig>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```
**Consuming Anon Aadhar Validation into our Custom Forms**
``` 
const [anonAadhaar] = useAnonAadhaar();
  useEffect(() => {
    if (anonAadhaar.status === 'logged-in') {
      formik.setFieldValue('anonAadhaarLoggedIn', true);
    }
  }, [anonAadhaar]);
```
```
<div className="mb-6">
        <Label>Verify your identity with Anon Aadhaar</Label>
        <LogInWithAnonAadhaar />
        ...
```

### Push Protocol
 - **Usage**:
   - **Support Chat**: Used for offering real-time chat support to the users directly, eliminating the need for users to switch to external platforms, creating a seamless and convenient experience.
   - **P2P Chat:** To facilitate secure and decentralized peer-to-peer communication between users without the need for centralized servers and intermediaries, ensuring privacy and data ownership.
   - **Token Gated Chat:** Used for restricting access to specific groups of users based on their token ownership. This enables the creation of exclusive communities for high-value users, fostering deeper engagement and loyalty.
   - **Push Notification:** This enables Servify to send real-time notifications to users' wallets or mobile devices, keeping them informed about important events, updates, and reminders.
 - **Implementation**: Code with the implementation of Push Protocol is housed in `server/notifications/notifications.service.ts`. [Link](https://github.com/karanpargal/sigmanerds/blob/main/server/notifications/notifications.service.ts)


### Scroll
 - **Usage**: Contracts pertaining to Servify are deployed on Scroll.
 - **Implementation**: Sepolia Testnet Explorer on https://sepolia.scrollscan.com/
   - SBT on Scroll: `0x189D6807030b09D86CA4c61c8bfE22DDcA4A682E` [Link](https://sepolia.scrollscan.com/address/0x189D6807030b09D86CA4c61c8bfE22DDcA4A682E)
   - Escrow on Scroll: `0x25Bb7EB5AbcE2B2245Ac2E5dDD3988765f624FE5` [Link](https://sepolia.scrollscan.com/address/0x25bb7eb5abce2b2245ac2e5ddd3988765f624fe5)


## üí™ Challenges Faced (and WAGMI!)
- **Developer Experience of SDKs**: Inadequate or unclear documentation did significantly hinder our developer experience as implementation was difficult in the given duration with limited support.
- **Figuring out the Settlement Flow**: Another challenge we encountered was optimizing the settlement flow, especially in cases where users were dissatisfied with the service provided. Balancing flexibility for both users and providers presented a nuanced trade-off. 
  - Ultimately, we resolved this by implementing a support chat feature. This solution aimed to address user concerns efficiently, allowing for real-time communication and issue resolution. 
  - The introduction of the support chat provided a streamlined approach to handle disputes or dissatisfaction, promoting a user-centric and responsive system for dispute resolution within the service.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's Next
- **Enable direct off-ramping of cryptocurrency**: Enabling direct off-ramping of cryptocurrency can be simplified through the integration of the Saber SDK by Mudrex. This SDK streamlines the process, allowing for a seamless conversion of crypto assets into traditional fiat currencies. With Mudrex's Saber SDK, users can efficiently and directly withdraw their crypto holdings, providing a user-friendly and convenient off-ramping solution. The SDK's features facilitate a straightforward experience, ensuring that users can easily convert and access the value of their cryptocurrencies in traditional financial systems. This integration enhances accessibility and usability, contributing to a more versatile and user-centric crypto off-ramping experience.

- **Enable easier on-boarding with the help of OKTO Wallet**: Okto Wallet or any similar wallet service can enhance the onboarding experience for users, making it efficient, secure, and user-friendly.
